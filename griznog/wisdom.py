As I continue to wander down the rabbithole of the \"bullshit jobs\" meme, considering what human activity and mores are actually worthwhile and contribute to a meaningful existence, things like this are standing out more and more often to me. I'll quote that paragraph here with variables as placeholders and ask the rhetorical question, how often does this get repeated across the breadth of our technology landscape?\n\nWhat is $TOOLNAME?\n$TOOLNAME is a suite of open-source development tools for creating and running computational workflows. $TOOLNAME Tools are developed by $GROUP_OF_PEOPLE with the goal of empowering researchers and developers to easily run reproducible analyses at scale.\n  I've long since lost count of the number of these types of tools. Of the now dozens+ I've dealt with over the years, I can't recall a single one that did better than an adept Makefile author with a shared filesystem available could have done. But there seems to be no shortage of people/groups who, while apparently unable to muster the intellect to process the make manpage, seem to suffer from the delusion that they are deep enough thinkers to \"disrupt\" the concept of a workflow and somehow make \"reproducible\" things even though we've had reproducible things since the very first computer program ran successfully (before that its bugs were reproducible).\n  This (and things similar) leave me in a conflicted state. As an ecologist, I cling to the idea that diversity is a Good Thing(tm) and because of this I cringe a bit at, for instance, the elimination of mosquitoes, as I see everything as part of the whole and the whole as evolving and changing continuously. Thus I value mosquitoes, even though I find them annoying. But applying that analogy to the tech world leaves me wondering, are all new ideas in this diverse realm just mosquitoes? What is the value of an ecosystem made up solely of subtly different parasites?\n  Circling back around to the idea of bullshit jobs, I wind up wondering how much of our computing technology is bullshit tech? I spent some time in my logs this morning and watched systemd and dbus doing their thing. Absolutely nothing of value provided by either. Before they existed we could watch movies, play sounds, edit files, reboot our machines, etc... Now things like systemd more and more become the source of problems, with a negative feedback loop as more projects incorporate this bullshit into their own bullshit. Would Poettering be in a position to pepper us continually with brokenness and stupidity if our culture didn't equate morality and goodness with $HOURS_WORKED? He (and I, sadly) had to find something to do to be viewed as valuable to society; wouldn't we all be better off if he (and all the other mosquito breeders) had been raised in a world where teaching and service were the highest valued ways to spend time. A world where crap work like programming was left to degenerate, anti-social monsters who couldn't function out in normal society?\n Of course, maybe I am underestimating the degenerate, anti-social monster population and things like workflow tools and systemd were inevitable irrespective of societal values.",

While I too am opposed to seeing a culture that values it (as many Asian cultures do) be restricted due to having the marker, at the same time how do we encourage other cultures to value it if they can't get admitted? This is the classic bootstrapping problem, how to people pull themselves by the bootstraps if they can't get bootstraps? The real solution is to provide free tuition to qualified students at public universities and community colleges and wait 2 or 3 (or more in some cases) generations for the problem to resolve itself. What Ivy league schools do impact, however, is the 1%. From that perspective one could say that considering race to increase diversity is reducing the white privilege over the long term and preventing it from becoming a swap for white for some other cultural optimization at that upper income level. I'd prefer to tackle that problem with a very, very progressive income tax and a big change in how capital gains are taxed (to fund the aforementioned public educations), but I don't see that happening anytime soon.\n",

I take the position that greater than half of all organizational effort is self-supporting waste/noise. In this case, simply allowing people more control over their work environment rather than categorizing them and building layers of effort and emotion on that categorization while trying to integrate them into an arbitrary "normal" environment could (I hypothesize) be better for everyone doing actual useful work. The utility of these categorizations and resulting fluff depends on accepting the status quo, which I pretty much reject as a sub-optimal solution. Biology won\'t overcome the downsides of taxonomy anytime soon and I suspect the human drive to categorize, sort and label individuals (with a heavy preference for a binomial metric) will haunt us until we are replaced by something better.\n',

Because of this things are built up to a peak point of usefulness, after which they either are abandoned and go into decline eventually crumbling or they get 'features' added until the original usefulness is buried under layers of arbitrary, over-hyped abstraction. The second epiphany was that I realized as I get older I do not crave the 'good old days'; if you follow the data there is no such thing as 'good old days'. What I crave are those lost usefulness peaks that will never be matched as the new peaks are shorter and yet at the same time the things themselves are more complex and less robust. Ultimately what I see from my cynical perch is technology following the same path we've seen in academic administration during the course of my life, an explosion of meaningless, pointless, often duplicated effort that drains resources and leaves people feeling empty, as if their life is about nothing more than incrementally 'improving' targeted ads.\n",
